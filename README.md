# Mission 0 - Homepage

This webpage is designed based off of a simple wireframe template, with the goal to make a rough homepage while ensuring mobile functionality and responsiveness.

---

No functionality as of yet. Homepage is created as a prototype based on a given wireframe. Mobile responsiveness does function as expected. This was done without media queries in order to more accurately learn mobile responsiveness and the different types of dynamic sizing options available in CSS.

## Usage

To access and preview this webpage, in the terminal of the folder *(mission0)*, type the following:
```
npm run dev
```
After that is done, **ctrl + click** on the appropriate link in the console to open the webpage.

To simulate mobile responsiveness, right click anywhere on the page and click inspect to open up the developer tools. Depending on your browser, there is a mobile preview button *(typically top-left or top-right)* that you can click to change the simulated screen size.
