# Mission 1 - Car Type AI Prediction Tool

This simple webpage is used as a prototype for an AI prediction tool. It reads any image, and spits out a prediction percentage as well as what type of car (e.g. SUV, sedan, hatchback, truck) it is.

The tool is still a <u>prototype</u> and has only had ~20 images to test from. This is the first iteration prediction model. It's approximate accuracy according to a quick test is **~75%.**

## Usage

To access and preview this webpage, in the terminal of the folder *(mission1/server and mission1/client)*, type the following:
```
npm run dev
```
After that is done, **ctrl + click** on the appropriate link in the console to open the webpage.

To simulate mobile responsiveness, right click anywhere on the page and click inspect to open up the developer tools. Depending on your browser, there is a mobile preview button *(typically top-left or top-right)* that you can click to change the simulated screen size.
